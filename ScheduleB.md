# Schedule B  
## Family Investment Company (FIC) Structure, Purpose, and Operating Mandate  
*(To be read together with [Schedule A](Schedule.md). In the event of ambiguity, Schedule A expresses the investment philosophy; Schedule B expresses the structural implementation.)*

# 1. Purpose of Schedule B

This Schedule defines the structure, purpose, and operational rules of the **Family Investment Company (FIC)** through which the Trustees shall implement the investment mandate set out in Schedule A.

Schedule B encodes the Founder’s intent that:

- The Trust shall **control** the FIC.  
- The FIC shall **own and operate** the **SDG Portfolio** as defined in **[sdg.md](sdg.md)**.  
- The FIC shall apply the **60/40 Rule** (60% distribution, 40% reinvestment).  
- The FIC shall operate as a **permanent, multi‑generational compounding engine**.  
- Beneficiaries shall receive income **only**, not capital.  
- Capital shall remain **locked and compounding indefinitely**.

This structure replaces the “trust‑holds‑assets” model with a **trust‑controls‑company‑that‑holds‑assets** model, which is materially more tax‑efficient and operationally robust.

# 2. Structural Overview

## 2.1 The Trust
The Trust shall hold **100% of the voting shares** of the FIC.  
The Trustees therefore retain:

- Full control of the FIC’s governance  
- Power to appoint and remove directors  
- Power to enforce the 60/40 Rule  
- Power to enforce the SDG investment mandate in **[sdg.md](sdg.md)**  

The Trust **does not** hold the investment assets directly.

## 2.2 The Family Investment Company (FIC)
The FIC shall:

- Hold the **SDG Portfolio** as defined in **[sdg.md](sdg.md)**  
- Receive dividends **free of UK dividend tax**  
- Reinvest 40% of net dividends  
- Distribute 60% of net dividends to the income beneficiaries  
- Maintain capital in perpetuity  
- Operate with **minimal turnover**  
- Replace assets only when required by the criteria in **[sdg.md](sdg.md)**  

The FIC is the **compounding engine**; the Trust is the **control mechanism**.

## 2.3 Share Classes
The FIC shall issue:

- **Voting Shares** (held exclusively by the Trust)  
- **Non‑Voting Growth Shares** (held by beneficiaries or by the Trust on their behalf)  
- **Freezer Shares** (optional; used to cap the Founder’s estate value)  

Voting Shares carry **all** governance rights.  
Growth Shares carry **all** economic rights.

# 3. Rationale for the Trust + FIC Pairing

## 3.1 Tax Efficiency
The FIC receives dividends **free of UK dividend tax**, subject only to foreign withholding tax.  
This is materially more efficient than a discretionary trust, which suffers:

- 39.35% dividend tax  
- No dividend allowance  
- Reduced reinvestment efficiency  

The FIC therefore compounds at nearly **double** the reinvestment efficiency of a trust.

## 3.2 Governance and Control
The Trust retains:

- Control of the FIC  
- Control of directors  
- Control of distributions  
- Control of adherence to **[sdg.md](sdg.md)**  

Beneficiaries cannot:

- Liquidate assets  
- Redirect capital  
- Override the 60/40 Rule  
- Alter the investment mandate  

This preserves the Founder’s intent across generations.

## 3.3 Capital Protection
The FIC structure ensures:

- Capital cannot be distributed  
- Capital cannot be encumbered  
- Capital cannot be accessed by beneficiaries  
- Capital remains invested in the **SDG Portfolio** defined in **[sdg.md](sdg.md)**  

This mirrors the capital‑preservation intent of Schedule A.

## 3.4 Multi‑Generational Stability
The Trust + FIC pairing provides:

- A perpetual legal entity (the FIC)  
- A perpetual governance mechanism (the Trust)  
- A perpetual investment mandate (Schedule A + **sdg.md**)  
- A perpetual income mechanism (60/40 Rule)  

This is the closest UK law provides to a **dynastic, perpetual compounding engine**.

# 4. Operating Rules of the FIC

## 4.1 The 60/40 Rule
The FIC shall:

- Distribute **60%** of net dividends to the income beneficiaries  
- Reinvest **40%** of net dividends into the **SDG Portfolio** defined in **[sdg.md](sdg.md)**  

This rule is mandatory and shall be encoded in:

- The Articles of Association  
- The Shareholders’ Agreement  
- Trustee governance instructions  

## 4.2 Investment Mandate
The FIC shall implement the SDG Portfolio exactly as defined in **[sdg.md](sdg.md)**:

- 20–30 high‑quality global dividend‑growth equities  
- Low turnover  
- Buy‑and‑hold philosophy  
- Replacement only upon fundamental deterioration  
- No market timing  
- No leverage  
- No derivatives  

**sdg.md** remains the **source of truth** for investment selection.

## 4.3 Rebalancing Policy
To minimise corporation tax on capital gains:

- Rebalancing shall be **minimised**  
- Rebalancing shall occur only when:  
  - A position exceeds risk thresholds  
  - A company is replaced under the rules in **sdg.md**  
  - A corporate action requires it  

The FIC shall rely primarily on **dividend reinvestment** for soft rebalancing.

## 4.4 Replacement Policy
Asset replacement shall occur only when the criteria in **[sdg.md](sdg.md)** are triggered, including:

- Dividend growth failure  
- ROIC deterioration  
- Earnings deterioration  
- Competitive advantage erosion  
- Dividend policy weakening  
- Strategic impairment  

Replacements typically occur at a **loss or low gain**, minimising CGT.

# 5. Distribution Rules

## 5.1 Beneficiary Eligibility
Only the **oldest living generation** shall receive distributions.  
This mirrors the intent of Schedule A and the design of **sdg.md**.

## 5.2 Distribution Mechanism
The FIC shall:

- Declare dividends on the **Growth Shares**  
- Pay these dividends to the Trust or directly to beneficiaries (as directed by Trustees)  
- Ensure distributions equal **60% of net dividends received**  

Beneficiaries pay **personal dividend tax** on distributions.

## 5.3 No Capital Distributions
The FIC shall not:

- Return capital  
- Repurchase shares (except for governance reasons)  
- Liquidate assets for beneficiary benefit  

Capital is permanently locked.

---

# 6. Succession and Control

## 6.1 Trustee Control
The Trust shall always hold **100% of the Voting Shares**.  
Trustees therefore control:

- Appointment and removal of directors  
- Amendments to Articles  
- Enforcement of the 60/40 Rule  
- Enforcement of **sdg.md**  

## 6.2 Director Succession
The Articles shall specify:

- Automatic appointment of successor directors  
- Trustee power to appoint/remove directors  
- Founder’s governance intent  

## 6.3 Beneficiary Rights
Beneficiaries have:

- No voting rights  
- No capital rights  
- No power to alter the mandate  
- Only the right to receive income when they are the oldest living generation  

This preserves dynastic stability.

# 7. Purpose and Intent

The Founder’s intent is that:

- The **SDG Portfolio** defined in **[sdg.md](sdg.md)** shall compound for centuries  
- Capital shall remain invested and protected  
- Income shall rise across generations  
- No beneficiary shall ever experience poverty  
- No beneficiary shall ever control or liquidate the capital  
- The Trust + FIC pairing shall operate as a **perpetual compounding engine**  
- The 60/40 Rule shall ensure sustainability and growth  
- The Trustees shall interpret all documents in favour of:  
  - Capital preservation  
  - Dividend growth  
  - Multi‑generational stability  
  - Fidelity to **sdg.md**  

Schedule B therefore encodes the structural implementation of Schedule A’s philosophy.

---

# 8. Interpretation

If ambiguity arises:

- **Schedule A** governs *investment philosophy and asset selection*  
- **sdg.md** governs *the specific portfolio and replacement rules*  
- **Schedule B** governs *structure, governance, and implementation*  

All documents must be interpreted to preserve:

- Capital  
- Compounding  
- Dividend growth  
- Multi‑generational benefit  
- The Founder’s intent  

---

# 9. Final Intent

The Founder intends that the Trust + FIC structure shall:

- Operate indefinitely  
- Provide rising income to successive generations  
- Maintain capital in perpetuity  
- Avoid unnecessary taxation  
- Avoid governance drift  
- Avoid liquidation  
- Serve as a dynastic engine for poverty eradication and opportunity creation  

The Trustees shall interpret this Schedule in a manner that maximises:

- Long‑term compounding  
- Stability  
- Integrity of the SDG Portfolio  
- Fidelity to **sdg.md**
