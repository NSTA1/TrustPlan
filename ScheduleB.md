# Schedule B  
## Family Investment Company (FIC) Structure, Purpose, and Operating Mandate  
*(To be read together with [Schedule A](Schedule.md). In the event of ambiguity, Schedule A expresses the investment philosophy; Schedule B expresses the structural implementation.)*

---

# 1. Purpose of Schedule B

This Schedule defines the structure, purpose, and operational rules of the **Family Investment Company (FIC)** through which the Trustees shall implement the investment mandate set out in Schedule A.

Schedule B encodes the Founder’s intent that:

- The Trust shall **control** the FIC.  
- The FIC shall **own and operate** the **SDG Portfolio** as defined in **[sdg.md](sdg.md)**.  
- The FIC shall apply the **60/40 Rule** (60% distribution, 40% reinvestment).  
- The FIC shall operate as a **permanent, multi‑generational compounding engine**.  
- Beneficiaries shall receive income **only**, not capital.  
- Capital shall remain **locked and compounding indefinitely**.

This structure replaces the “trust‑holds‑assets” model with a **trust‑controls‑company‑that‑holds‑assets** model, which is materially more tax‑efficient and operationally robust.

---

# 2. Structural Overview

## 2.1 The Trust
The Trust shall hold **100% of the voting shares** of the FIC.  
The Trustees therefore retain:

- Full control of the FIC’s governance  
- Power to appoint and remove directors  
- Power to enforce the 60/40 Rule  
- Power to enforce the SDG investment mandate in **[sdg.md](sdg.md)**  

The Trust **does not** hold the investment assets directly.

## 2.2 The Family Investment Company (FIC)
The FIC shall:

- Hold the **SDG Portfolio** as defined in **[sdg.md](sdg.md)**  
- Receive dividends **free of UK dividend tax**  
- Reinvest 40% of net dividends  
- Distribute 60% of net dividends to the income beneficiaries  
- Maintain capital in perpetuity  
- Operate with **minimal turnover**  
- Replace assets only when required by the criteria in **[sdg.md](sdg.md)**  

The FIC is the **compounding engine**; the Trust is the **control mechanism**.

## 2.3 Share Classes
The FIC shall issue:

- **Voting Shares** (held exclusively by the Trust)  
- **Non‑Voting Growth Shares** (held by beneficiaries or by the Trust on their behalf)  
- **Freezer Shares** (optional; used to cap the Founder’s estate value)  

Voting Shares carry **all** governance rights.  
Growth Shares carry **all** economic rights.

# 3. Rationale for the Trust + FIC Pairing

## 3.1 Tax Efficiency
The FIC receives dividends **free of UK dividend tax**, subject only to foreign withholding tax.  
This is materially more efficient than a discretionary trust, which suffers:

- 39.35% dividend tax  
- No dividend allowance  
- Reduced reinvestment efficiency  

The FIC therefore compounds at nearly **double** the reinvestment efficiency of a trust.

## 3.2 Governance and Control
The Trust retains:

- Control of the FIC  
- Control of directors  
- Control of distributions  
- Control of adherence to **[sdg.md](sdg.md)**  

Beneficiaries cannot:

- Liquidate assets  
- Redirect capital  
- Override the 60/40 Rule  
- Alter the investment mandate  

This preserves the Founder’s intent across generations.

## 3.3 Capital Protection
The FIC structure ensures:

- Capital cannot be distributed  
- Capital cannot be encumbered  
- Capital cannot be accessed by beneficiaries  
- Capital remains invested in the **SDG Portfolio** defined in **[sdg.md](sdg.md)**  

This mirrors the capital‑preservation intent of Schedule A.

## 3.4 Multi‑Generational Stability
The Trust + FIC pairing provides:

- A perpetual legal entity (the FIC)  
- A perpetual governance mechanism (the Trust)  
- A perpetual investment mandate (Schedule A + **sdg.md**)  
- A perpetual income mechanism (60/40 Rule)  

This is the closest UK law provides to a **dynastic, perpetual compounding engine**.

# 4. Operating Rules of the FIC

## 4.1 The 60/40 Rule
The FIC shall:

- Distribute **60%** of net dividends to the income beneficiaries  
- Reinvest **40%** of net dividends into the **SDG Portfolio** defined in **[sdg.md](sdg.md)**  

This rule is mandatory and shall be encoded in:

- The Articles of Association  
- The Shareholders’ Agreement  
- Trustee governance instructions  

## 4.2 Investment Mandate
The FIC shall implement the SDG Portfolio exactly as defined in **[sdg.md](sdg.md)**:

- 20–30 high‑quality global dividend‑growth equities  
- Low turnover  
- Buy‑and‑hold philosophy  
- Replacement only upon fundamental deterioration  
- No market timing  
- No leverage  
- No derivatives  

**sdg.md** remains the **source of truth** for investment selection.

## 4.3 Rebalancing Policy
To minimise corporation tax on capital gains:

- Rebalancing shall be **minimised**  
- Rebalancing shall occur only when:  
  - A position exceeds risk thresholds  
  - A company is replaced under the rules in **sdg.md**  
  - A corporate action requires it  

The FIC shall rely primarily on **dividend reinvestment** for soft rebalancing.

## 4.4 Replacement Policy
Asset replacement shall occur only when the criteria in **[sdg.md](sdg.md)** are triggered, including:

- Dividend growth failure  
- ROIC deterioration  
- Earnings deterioration  
- Competitive advantage erosion  
- Dividend policy weakening  
- Strategic impairment  

Replacements typically occur at a **loss or low gain**, minimising CGT.

# 5. Distribution Rules

## 5.1 Beneficiary Eligibility
Only the **oldest living generation** shall receive distributions.  
This mirrors the intent of Schedule A and the design of **sdg.md**.

## 5.2 Distribution Mechanism
The FIC shall:

- Declare dividends on the **Growth Shares**  
- Pay these dividends to the Trust or directly to beneficiaries (as directed by Trustees)  
- Ensure distributions equal **60% of net dividends received**  

Beneficiaries pay **personal dividend tax** on distributions.

## 5.3 No Capital Distributions
The FIC shall not:

- Return capital  
- Repurchase shares (except for governance reasons)  
- Liquidate assets for beneficiary benefit  

Capital is permanently locked.

---

# 6. Succession and Control

## 6.1 Trustee Control
The Trust shall always hold **100% of the Voting Shares**.  
Trustees therefore control:

- Appointment and removal of directors  
- Amendments to Articles  
- Enforcement of the 60/40 Rule  
- Enforcement of **sdg.md**  

## 6.2 Director Succession
The Articles shall specify:

- Automatic appointment of successor directors  
- Trustee power to appoint/remove directors  
- Founder’s governance intent  

## 6.3 Beneficiary Rights
Beneficiaries have:

- No voting rights  
- No capital rights  
- No power to alter the mandate  
- Only the right to receive income when they are the oldest living generation  

This preserves dynastic stability.

---

# 7. Purpose and Intent

The Founder’s intent is that:

- The **SDG Portfolio** defined in **[sdg.md](sdg.md)** shall compound for centuries  
- Capital shall remain invested and protected  
- Income shall rise across generations  
- No beneficiary shall ever experience poverty  
- No beneficiary shall ever control or liquidate the capital  
- The Trust + FIC pairing shall operate as a **perpetual compounding engine**  
- The 60/40 Rule shall ensure sustainability and growth  
- The Trustees shall interpret all documents in favour of:  
  - Capital preservation  
  - Dividend growth  
  - Multi‑generational stability  
  - Fidelity to **sdg.md**  

Schedule B therefore encodes the structural implementation of Schedule A’s philosophy.

---

# 8. Interpretation

If ambiguity arises:

- **Schedule A** governs *investment philosophy and asset selection*  
- **sdg.md** governs *the specific portfolio and replacement rules*  
- **Schedule B** governs *structure, governance, and implementation*  

All documents must be interpreted to preserve:

- Capital  
- Compounding  
- Dividend growth  
- Multi‑generational benefit  
- The Founder’s intent  

---

# 9. Final Intent

The Founder intends that the Trust + FIC structure shall:

- Operate indefinitely  
- Provide rising income to successive generations  
- Maintain capital in perpetuity  
- Avoid unnecessary taxation  
- Avoid governance drift  
- Avoid liquidation  
- Serve as a dynastic engine for poverty eradication and opportunity creation  

The Trustees shall interpret this Schedule in a manner that maximises:

- Long‑term compounding  
- Stability  
- Integrity of the SDG Portfolio  
- Fidelity to **sdg.md**

# 10. Transition to a Successor Trust at the 125‑Year Limit

## 10.1 Purpose of This Section
This Section ensures that the statutory 125‑year limit on the duration of UK trusts shall not impede, interrupt, or diminish the perpetual operation of the Family Investment Company (FIC) or the Founder’s intent as expressed in Schedule A, Schedule B, and sdg.md.

Its purpose is to mandate a mechanical, automatic, and unchallengeable transition of control from the expiring trust (“the Outgoing Trust”) to a newly constituted trust (“the Successor Trust”) so that governance, capital protection, and the SDG Portfolio continue without interruption.

This Section shall be interpreted strictly and literally, without discretion.

## 10.2 Mandatory Creation of the Successor Trust
No later than twelve (12) months before the statutory expiry of the Outgoing Trust:

- The Trustees shall constitute a new trust governed by the laws of England & Wales or Scotland (as applicable).
- The new trust shall be named “The [Family Name] Successor Trust [Year]” or a substantially similar name.
- The Successor Trust shall adopt, without modification:
  - Schedule A (investment philosophy)
  - Schedule B (structural rules)
  - sdg.md (portfolio and replacement rules)
  - All governance instructions, restrictions, and mandates of the Outgoing Trust

The Successor Trust’s duration shall begin only upon receipt of the Voting Shares.

## 10.3 Mandatory Transfer of Control of the FIC
Exactly six (6) months before the statutory expiry of the Outgoing Trust:

- The Trustees of the Outgoing Trust shall transfer 100% of the Voting Shares of the FIC to the Successor Trust.
- This transfer shall occur automatically, without discretion, and shall not require beneficiary consent.
- The transfer shall not constitute a distribution, appointment, advancement, or settlement for the benefit of any beneficiary.
- The transfer shall be treated solely as a governance transition.

Upon transfer:

- The Successor Trust becomes the sole controller of the FIC.
- The Outgoing Trust ceases to have any governance rights over the FIC.
- The FIC continues uninterrupted, with no change to its Articles, mandate, or operations.

## 10.4 Continuity of Governance and Mandate
The Successor Trust shall:

- Hold 100% of the Voting Shares of the FIC
- Enforce the 60/40 Rule
- Enforce the SDG Portfolio as defined in sdg.md
- Enforce all replacement rules
- Enforce all capital‑preservation rules
- Maintain the Founder’s intent exactly as expressed in Schedule A and Schedule B

No Trustee, beneficiary, director, or advisor shall have discretion to modify, dilute, or reinterpret these obligations.

## 10.5 Prohibition on Alteration of Intent
Neither the Outgoing Trust nor the Successor Trust may:

- Alter the SDG Portfolio rules  
- Alter the 60/40 Rule  
- Alter the capital‑preservation mandate  
- Alter the governance structure of the FIC  
- Alter the Founder’s intent  

The transition is administrative only, not substantive.

## 10.6 Automatic Replication of Future Successor Trusts
This Section shall apply in perpetuity.

Every Successor Trust shall:

- Create its own successor no later than 12 months before its expiry
- Transfer the Voting Shares exactly 6 months before expiry
- Replicate this Section in full
- Maintain unbroken dynastic control of the FIC

This ensures that the FIC remains a perpetual compounding engine, unaffected by statutory trust limits.

## 10.7 Interpretation
If any ambiguity arises in the application of this Section:

- The interpretation that maximises continuity of control,
- maximises capital preservation,
- maximises adherence to Schedule A and sdg.md, and
- minimises risk of governance drift

shall prevail.

No interpretation shall be permitted that weakens, delays, or complicates the transition to the Successor Trust.
