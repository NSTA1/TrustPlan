# SDG Improvement Addendum  
*Enhancements to strengthen mechanical clarity, economic durability, and dynastic resilience.*

---

## 1. Mechanical Enhancements

### 1.1 Asset Replacement Rules
To prevent long‑run drift and ensure the portfolio remains aligned with high‑ROIC, high‑DG principles:

**Replacement Trigger:**  
An asset must be replaced if all of the following are true for 3 consecutive years:
- Real dividend growth < 0%  
- ROIC < 10%  
- No credible turnaround plan disclosed by management  

**Replacement Procedure:**  
Replace the asset with the highest‑ROIC candidate within the same sleeve that meets:
- ROIC ≥ 15%  
- Positive real dividend growth  
- Global revenue footprint  

---

### 1.2 Corporate Action Rules
To avoid ambiguity during mergers, spin‑offs, or delistings:

- **Spin‑offs:** Retain both parent and child securities until the next annual rebalance, then reintegrate according to target weights.  
- **Mergers/Acquisitions:** If the acquired entity ceases to exist, proceeds must be reinvested into the sleeve’s remaining assets at target weights.  
- **Delistings:** Treat as a forced sale and reinvest proceeds at target weights.

---

### 1.3 Volatility‑Triggered Rebalancing Override
In addition to annual January rebalancing:

**Rule:**  
If any sleeve deviates by more than ±25% from its target weight at any point during the year, perform an immediate rebalance to target weights.

---

## 2. Economic Enhancements

### 2.1 Future Moat Incubator Sleeve (2–3%)
A small sleeve dedicated to emerging high‑ROIC compounders.

**Eligibility Criteria:**
- ROIC ≥ 20%  
- Revenue growth ≥ 15%  
- Low or zero payout ratio  
- Global TAM expansion  

This sleeve is rebalanced annually and capped at 3% of NAV.

---

### 2.2 Zero‑Yield Asset Maturity Rule
Zero‑yield assets (e.g., Amazon) transition into the main dividend sleeve when:

- They initiate a dividend, **and**  
- Their real dividend growth falls below 5% for 5 consecutive years.

---

### 2.3 Portfolio‑Level Dividend Growth Floor
To maintain long‑run compounding power:

**Rule:**  
If blended real dividend growth falls below 4% for 5 consecutive years, the trustee must replace the lowest‑ROIC asset with a higher‑ROIC candidate within the same sleeve.

---

## 3. Risk & Resilience Enhancements

### 3.1 Catastrophic‑Event Override
If an asset faces structural impairment (e.g., nationalisation risk, permanent regulatory damage):

- Trustee must divest within 12 months.  
- Proceeds reinvested into the sleeve at target weights.

---

### 3.2 FX Regime‑Shift Review Rule
Although modelling ignores FX, operational governance should not.

**Trigger:**  
If any currency depreciates more than 30% in real terms over a rolling 10‑year window:

- Trustee must review withholding tax, repatriation risk, and dividend stability.  
- No automatic selling; this is a governance review only.

---

## 4. Dynastic & Governance Enhancements

### 4.1 No‑Interpretation Clause
To prevent future trustees from altering the strategy:

**Prohibited Changes:**
- ESG overlays  
- Market timing  
- Factor tilts  
- Thematic investing  
- Alternatives (private equity, hedge funds, crypto)  
- Style drift of any kind  

The SDG mandate must remain unchanged.

---

### 4.2 Canonical Document Hierarchy
To avoid future ambiguity:

1. Will  
2. Schedule A  
3. SDG Design  
4. Modelling Appendix  
5. SDG Improvement Addendum  
6. Trustee Operating Manual  

Lower documents cannot override higher ones.

---

### 4.3 25‑Year Modelling Update Cycle
Every 25 years, trustees must update:

- Dividend growth estimates  
- NAV growth ranges  
- Withholding tax assumptions  
- Correlation matrices  

**The investment mandate itself must not be changed.**

---

## 5. Income & Withdrawal Enhancements

### 5.1 Dynamic Income‑Smoothing Rule
To protect NAV during shocks:

**Rule:**  
If real dividend income falls by more than 20% year‑over‑year, withdrawals revert to a 50/50 split (income/reinvestment) until income recovers to prior levels.

---

### 5.2 Surplus Income Allocation
If real dividend income exceeds expected levels by more than 20%:

- 50% reinvested  
- 50% distributed as beneficiary bonuses  
- No selling of units permitted  

---

## 6. Documentation Enhancements

### 6.1 Canonical Glossary
A glossary must be maintained defining all technical terms, including:
- ROIC  
- Dividend growth  
- NAV  
- Real terms  
- Withholding tax  
- Correlation  
- Rebalancing  

---

### 6.2 Annual Trustee Checklist
A deterministic checklist to ensure operational continuity:

1. Apply NAV returns  
2. Apply dividend growth  
3. Pay dividends  
4. Reinvest according to rules  
5. Apply contributions (if applicable)  
6. Withdraw income (post‑Year 25)  
7. Rebalance in January  
8. Update records and compliance logs
