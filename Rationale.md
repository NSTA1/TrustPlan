# SDG Trust: Rationale & Intent Document  
*A clear, emphatic, and unambiguous statement of purpose for trustees and future generations.*

---

# 1. Purpose of This Document
This document explains **why** the SDG portfolio is constructed the way it is, **why** the rules must be followed exactly as written, and **what outcomes the structure is designed to produce** over decades and centuries.

It is not a discretionary guide.  
It is a **statement of intent**, designed to eliminate ambiguity, prevent interpretation drift, and preserve the compounding engine across generations.

Trustees must follow the operational rules in the SDG Design exactly as written.  
This rationale document exists to ensure they understand the *purpose* behind those rules.

---

# 2. Core Intent of the SDG Portfolio

## 2.1 Long‑Run Dividend Compounding
The SDG portfolio is designed to maximise **real dividend income growth** over multi‑decade horizons.  
It prioritises:

- high ROIC  
- global monopolistic economics  
- low payout ratios  
- long runways for reinvestment  
- durable pricing power  

The goal is not early yield.  
The goal is **accelerating real income** that compounds for generations.

---

## 2.2 Zero Discretion for Trustees
The rules are deterministic because:

- discretion introduces drift  
- drift destroys compounding  
- compounding is the engine of the trust  

Trustees are operators, not portfolio managers.  
Their job is to execute the rules, not reinterpret them.

---

## 2.3 Global, High‑Quality, Low‑Turnover Structure
The portfolio is intentionally:

- globally diversified  
- economically concentrated in global monopolists  
- low‑turnover  
- tax‑efficient  
- simple to operate  
- robust across inflation, deflation, recessions, and currency regimes  

This structure is designed to survive **150+ years** of economic change.

---

# 3. Why These Rules Exist

## 3.1 Annual Rebalancing
Annual rebalancing:

- enforces discipline  
- prevents style drift  
- recycles dividends into high‑growth assets  
- maintains the intended economic exposures  

It is the simplest and most robust rebalancing frequency for a dynastic trust.

---

## 3.2 100% Reinvestment for 25 Years
This creates the **maximum compounding runway**.  
The trust must first build the engine before drawing income from it.

---

## 3.3 60/40 Income Split After Year 25
This rule:

- provides rising real income  
- preserves long‑run NAV growth  
- avoids forced selling  
- ensures the trust remains perpetual  

It is mathematically optimal for a dividend‑growth portfolio.

---

## 3.4 No Selling Except for Rebalancing
Selling introduces:

- behavioural errors  
- timing mistakes  
- tax drag  
- mandate drift  

The trust avoids all of these by prohibiting discretionary sales.

---

# 4. Expected Outcomes: Percentile Bands (Years 20–50)

These percentile bands are based on the modelling assumptions in the SDG Design:

- Real NAV growth: 7%  
- Real dividend growth: 8%  
- NAV volatility: 20%  
- DG volatility: 5%  
- Portfolio‑level vol reductions applied  
- All figures in **GBP real terms**  

They represent the **expected distribution** of outcomes, not guarantees.

---

# 4.1 NAV Percentile Bands (Years 20–50)

| Year | 5th %ile | 25th %ile | Median | 75th %ile | 95th %ile |
|------|----------|-----------|---------|-----------|-----------|
| 20 | £1.35m | £1.55m | £1.70m | £1.90m | £2.25m |
| 25 | £2.00m | £2.45m | £2.80m | £3.25m | £3.90m |
| 30 | £2.55m | £3.25m | £3.95m | £4.85m | £6.20m |
| 40 | £3.60m | £5.40m | £7.50m | £10.8m | £17.0m |
| 50 | £5.10m | £8.90m | £14.0m | £22.5m | £40.0m |

**Note:**  
The Year‑50 median NAV of **£14 million real** is the natural consequence of 7% real compounding on a £2.8m base.  
The 95th percentile illustrates the convexity of high‑ROIC assets under lognormal returns.

# 4.2 Total Dividend Income Percentile Bands (Years 20–50)

| Year | 5th %ile | 25th %ile | Median | 75th %ile | 95th %ile |
|------|----------|-----------|---------|-----------|-----------|
| 20 | £17k | £19k | £21k | £24k | £28k |
| 25 | £26k | £30k | £34k | £39k | £47k |
| 30 | £34k | £42k | £50k | £61k | £78k |
| 40 | £55k | £75k | £105k | £150k | £230k |
| 50 | £90k | £135k | £210k | £330k | £550k |

---

# 4.3 Income Taken (60% Rule, Years 26–50)

| Year | 5th %ile | 25th %ile | Median | 75th %ile | 95th %ile |
|------|----------|-----------|---------|-----------|-----------|
| 26 | £15k | £18k | £22k | £25k | £29k |
| 30 | £20k | £25k | £30k | £37k | £47k |
| 40 | £33k | £45k | £63k | £90k | £138k |
| 50 | £54k | £81k | £126k | £198k | £330k |

# 5. Interpretation of Percentile Bands

## 5.1 The 5th Percentile (Severe Stress)
Represents rare but plausible scenarios:

- prolonged global recession  
- multi‑year valuation compression  
- geopolitical shocks  
- inflation spikes followed by stagnation  
- low dividend growth across sectors  

Even here, the trust remains functional:

- NAV still compounds  
- income still rises  
- the trust remains perpetual  

This is the **worst realistic decade**, not a collapse scenario.

---

## 5.2 The 25th Percentile (Below‑Trend Markets)
Represents:

- moderate recessions  
- slower earnings growth  
- temporary dividend freezes  
- valuation headwinds  

Income still grows meaningfully.  
NAV still compounds above inflation.

---

## 5.3 The Median (Expected Path)
Represents:

- normal economic cycles  
- typical earnings growth  
- stable dividend growth  
- no extreme valuation distortions  

By Year 50:

- NAV ≈ **£14m real**  
- Total dividends ≈ **£210k real**  
- Income taken ≈ **£126k real**  

This is the “true north” of the trust.

---

## 5.4 The 75th Percentile (Strong Markets)
Represents:

- strong earnings cycles  
- high dividend growth  
- favourable valuations  
- strong global demand  

By Year 50:

- NAV ≈ **£22.5m real**  
- Income ≈ **£198k real**  

---

## 5.5 The 95th Percentile (Exceptional Conditions)
Represents:

- multi‑year bull markets  
- unusually strong ROIC expansion  
- rapid dividend growth  
- high reinvestment returns  

By Year 50:

- NAV ≈ **£40m real**  
- Income ≈ **£330k real**  

These outcomes are rare but possible.  
They demonstrate the **convexity** of high‑ROIC, high‑DG assets.

---

# 6. The Compounding Effect (Critical Insight)

The expansion to Year 50 highlights the defining feature of the SDG Trust:

## **Compounding accelerates. It does not progress linearly.**

- Year 25 median NAV: **£2.8m**  
- Year 30 median NAV: **£3.95m**  
- Year 40 median NAV: **£7.5m**  
- Year 50 median NAV: **£14m**  

The trust doubles roughly every **10–12 years in real terms**.

Dividend income follows the same curve:

- Year 25 median income: **£34k**  
- Year 30 median income: **£50k**  
- Year 40 median income: **£105k**  
- Year 50 median income: **£210k**  

This is the entire purpose of the SDG design:  
**a perpetual, accelerating, inflation‑beating income engine.**

# 7. Why Trustees Must Not Deviate

## 7.1 The Rules Are the Strategy
The SDG portfolio is not a collection of stocks.  
It is a **system**.

The system works only if:

- rebalancing is done correctly  
- contributions follow the schedule  
- withdrawals follow the 60/40 rule  
- no discretionary selling occurs  
- zero‑yield assets are treated correctly  
- replacement rules are followed exactly  

Deviation breaks the compounding engine.

---

## 7.2 The Rationale Protects Against Misinterpretation
This document ensures trustees understand:

- the purpose of the rules  
- the expected outcomes  
- the risks the trust is designed to withstand  
- the long‑run nature of the compounding engine  

Understanding prevents errors.

---

## 7.3 The Trust Must Survive Generational Drift
Over 150 years:

- trustees change  
- institutions change  
- markets change  
- incentives change  

The rules and rationale ensure the trust does not.

---

# 8. Final Statement of Intent
The SDG Trust is designed to:

- compound real dividend income for generations  
- preserve and grow real NAV  
- provide rising, inflation‑beating income  
- avoid discretionary decision‑making  
- remain robust across all economic regimes  
- operate as a perpetual, self‑reinforcing compounding engine  

Trustees must follow the rules exactly as written.  
This rationale document exists to ensure they understand **why**.
