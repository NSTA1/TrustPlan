# Downturn Fund Allocation

## Purpose
The Downturn Fund is a permanent, multi‑generational resilience mechanism designed to:
- provide dry powder for −10%, −20%, and −30% market drawdowns  
- increase long‑run share count through convex deployment  
- reduce sequence‑of‑returns risk across successive stewards  
- preserve operational clarity and mechanical execution  

The Downturn Fund is **not** part of the strategic asset allocation and must never be used for lifestyle spending, discretionary timing, or rebalancing.

## 1. Funding Structure

### 1.1 Initial Allocation
- Establish the Downturn Fund at **£15,000 (real, 2025 GBP)** at inception.

### 1.2 Ten‑Year Ramp‑Up Rule
For the first ten years after inception:
- Increase the Downturn Fund target by **£1,000 per year (real terms)**.
- These increases are additive and cumulative.
- Example:  
  - Year 1 target: £16,000  
  - Year 2 target: £17,000  
  - …  
  - Year 10 target: £25,000  

This ramp‑up ensures meaningful convexity during the highest‑impact compounding years.

## 2. Multi‑Generational Scaling Rule (Post‑Ramp)

After Year 10, the Downturn Fund target is determined mechanically as:

> **Downturn Fund Target = max( Real Floor , Percentage of NAV )**

Where:

### 2.1 Real Floor
- The real floor is the inflation‑linked value of **£15,000 (2025 GBP)**.
- This ensures the fund never becomes trivial in real terms.

### 2.2 Percentage of NAV
- Target percentage = **1.5% of total portfolio NAV** (real).
- This ensures the fund scales appropriately as the portfolio grows across generations.

### 2.3 Final Target
- Each year, compute both values and select the larger:
  - **Real Floor**  
  - **1.5% of NAV**

This rule ensures:
- the fund remains small relative to total capital  
- convexity remains meaningful even at multi‑million‑pound scale  
- drag remains minimal  
- the system remains simple and trustee‑ready  

---

## 3. Trustee Notes

- The Downturn Fund is a **permanent structural feature** of the portfolio’s resilience architecture.  
- The ramp‑up ensures early convexity; the scaling rule ensures multi‑generational relevance.  
- The fund must remain segregated, explicit, and mechanically governed.  
- **These rules are immutable. No steward, trustee, or successor may alter, reinterpret, override, or amend them under any circumstances. The Downturn Fund Allocation is a fixed and permanent component of the Strategy Document.**

  # Downturn Fund Funding

## 1. Funding Sources

### 1.1 Ramp‑Up Period (Years 1–10)
During the ten‑year ramp‑up period defined in the Downturn Fund Allocation section:
- The Downturn Fund is increased by **£1,000 per year (real terms)**.
- These increases are funded from **dedicated contributions**, not from dividends.

### 1.2 Post‑Ramp Period (Year 11 Onward)
After the ramp‑up period is complete:
- The Downturn Fund is funded **exclusively from portfolio dividends**.
- No external contributions, reallocations, or sales may be used.
- The Downturn Fund is a self‑funding, permanent component of the portfolio.

## 2. Funding Priority

### 2.1 Priority Over Reinvestment
Dividend flows must be allocated in the following strict order:

1. **First:**  
   Allocate dividends to bring the Downturn Fund up to its required target size, whether:
   - the target has increased due to the scaling rule, or  
   - the fund is being replenished after deployment.

2. **Second:**  
   Only after the Downturn Fund has reached its full target level may any remaining dividends be reinvested into the strategic allocation.

This ensures the Downturn Fund remains fully operational at all times and prevents erosion of its resilience function.

---

## 3. Insufficient Dividends

If dividends in a given year are insufficient to reach the required Downturn Fund target:
- The fund remains temporarily below target.
- Future dividends continue to be allocated **entirely** to the Downturn Fund until the target is met.
- No reinvestment of dividends may occur until the target is fully restored.

This rule ensures the Downturn Fund is always rebuilt mechanically and without discretionary judgement.

---

## 4. Trustee Notes

- The Downturn Fund must remain fully funded at its target level whenever possible.  
- Funding from dividends ensures the mechanism is self‑sustaining across generations.  
- Prioritising the Downturn Fund over reinvestment preserves its role as a permanent convexity and resilience buffer.  
- These funding rules are **immutable** and must be executed exactly as written.
