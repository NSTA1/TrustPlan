# Downturn Fund Allocation

## Purpose
The Downturn Fund is a permanent, multi‑generational resilience mechanism designed to:
- provide dry powder for −10%, −20%, and −30% market drawdowns  
- increase long‑run share count through convex deployment  
- reduce sequence‑of‑returns risk across successive stewards  
- preserve operational clarity and mechanical execution  

The Downturn Fund is **not** part of the strategic asset allocation and must never be used for lifestyle spending, discretionary timing, or rebalancing.

## 1. Funding Structure

### 1.1 Initial Allocation
- Establish the Downturn Fund at **£15,000 (real, 2025 GBP)** at inception.

### 1.2 Ten‑Year Ramp‑Up Rule
For the first ten years after inception:
- Increase the Downturn Fund target by **£1,000 per year (real terms)**.
- These increases are additive and cumulative.
- Example:  
  - Year 1 target: £16,000  
  - Year 2 target: £17,000  
  - …  
  - Year 10 target: £25,000  

This ramp‑up ensures meaningful convexity during the highest‑impact compounding years.

## 2. Multi‑Generational Scaling Rule (Post‑Ramp)

After Year 10, the Downturn Fund target is determined mechanically as:

> **Downturn Fund Target = max( Real Floor , Percentage of NAV )**

Where:

### 2.1 Real Floor
- The real floor is the inflation‑linked value of **£15,000 (2025 GBP)**.
- This ensures the fund never becomes trivial in real terms.

### 2.2 Percentage of NAV
- Target percentage = **1.5% of total portfolio NAV** (real).
- This ensures the fund scales appropriately as the portfolio grows across generations.

### 2.3 Final Target
- Each year, compute both values and select the larger:
  - **Real Floor**  
  - **1.5% of NAV**

This rule ensures:
- the fund remains small relative to total capital  
- convexity remains meaningful even at multi‑million‑pound scale  
- drag remains minimal  
- the system remains simple and trustee‑ready

## 3. Trustee Notes

- The Downturn Fund is a **permanent structural feature** of the portfolio’s resilience architecture.  
- The ramp‑up ensures early convexity; the scaling rule ensures multi‑generational relevance.  
- The fund must remain segregated, explicit, and mechanically governed.  
- **These rules are immutable. No steward, trustee, or successor may alter, reinterpret, override, or amend them under any circumstances. The Downturn Fund Allocation is a fixed and permanent component of the Strategy Document.**
