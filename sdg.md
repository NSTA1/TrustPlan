# SDG Design
- A high dividend growth portfolio which is not focused on early-stage yield, but rather on long term compounding of dividends and dividend growth.
- Holdings must be high ROIC equities with global exposure and established dividend track records (with the exception of a few 'dividend initiators': companies that have high ROIC but have recently started paying a dividend or are likely to in future [e.g. Amazon, Meta])

# Perpetual

To be managed by the Trustee of my choice upon my death as covered in my will and under the terms of [Schedule A](Schedule.md)

Current 5-year blended dividend growth: 12%

# Modelling Instructions
- Assume 2.5% average inflation for calculating real returns and/or income
- Assume 8% average annual NAV growth (20% volativity, 0.7% asset correlation)
- Portfolio forward dividend yield at time of initial investment: 1.3%
- Use dividend growth table with 5% standard deviation on growth
- Assume zero dividend stocks never initiate unless stated otherwise
- Always use real terms for final output, only show nominal if asked
- Always assume the Investment Plan section is the baseline investment strategy unless stated otherwise

  | Horizon (Years) | Real DG Assumption | Rationale |
|-----------------|--------------------|-----------|
| 0–50            | 8–10%              | High‑DG era: portfolio tilted to mega‑cap compounders with low payout ratios; replacement most effective. |
| 50–100          | 4–6%               | Opportunity set matures; trust larger; DG edge persists but competition and valuations compress future growth. |
| 100–150         | 2–3%               | Portfolio increasingly resembles a broad, system‑scale quality equity pool; DG still above macro but narrowing. |
| 150+            | 1–2%               | Convergence toward global real GDP growth; macro ceiling dominates; trust behaves like a large, mature endowment. |

# Generation Income Projection 

Assuming I die at 80 (G0) and each generation dies at 80, having two children when aged approximately 35:

t0 = 2026
