# SDG Design
- A high dividend growth portfolio which is not focused on early-stage yield, but rather on long term compounding of dividends and dividend growth.
- Holdings must be high ROIC equities with global exposure and established dividend track records (with the exception of a few 'dividend initiators': companies that have high ROIC but have recently started paying a dividend or are likely to in future).

# Perpetual

To be managed by the Trustee of my choice upon my death as covered in my will and under the terms of [Schedule A](Schedule.md)

# Contribution Plan
- £55,500 lump sum invested 9th December 2025
- After that lump sum, £2,300 contributed weekly until April 31st 2026
- £1,666 contributed monthly from the beginning of May 2026 for the next 25 years
- All dividends reinvested until the end of year 25 (invested immediately upon receipt)
- All contributions and dividends are invested in a self-balancing fashion to maintain the target asset allocations
- Until the end of year 25 (while in an ISA wrapper), the portfolio is re-balanced to target weights annually (each January)

# Withdrawals and Income
- After the investment period ends (25 years from May 2026), 60% of dividends are taken as income and the remaining 40% of dividend income is reinvested in the same self-balancing manner as during the investment period.
- No selling of assets is allowed unless explicitly forming part of a portfolio rebalancing activity

# Modelling Instructions

- Assume 2.5% average inflation for calculating real returns and/or income
- Assume 8% average annual NAV growth (20% volativity, 0.7% asset correlation)
- Use the **Forward Yield** section for dividend calculation
- Use dividend growth table with 5% standard deviation on growth
- Assume zero dividend stocks never initiate unless stated otherwise
- Always use real terms for final output, only show nominal if asked
- Always assume the **Contribution Plan** section is the baseline investment strategy unless stated otherwise

Dividend growth:

| Horizon (Years) | Real DG Assumption | Rationale |
|-----------------|--------------------|-----------|
| 0–50            | 8–10%             | High‑DG era: portfolio tilted to mega‑cap compounders with low payout ratios; replacement most effective. |
| 50–100          | 4–6%              | Opportunity set matures; trust larger; DG edge persists but competition and valuations compress future growth. |
| 100–150         | 2–3%              | Portfolio increasingly resembles a broad, system‑scale quality equity pool; DG still above macro but narrowing. |
| 150+            | 1–2%              | Convergence toward global real GDP growth; macro ceiling dominates; trust behaves like a large, mature endowment. |

Nav growth:

| Horizon (Years) | Real NAV Growth Assumption | Rationale |
|-----------------|-----------------------------|-----------|
| 0–50            | 6–8%                        | High‑growth era: portfolio small relative to global markets; reinvestment and high‑DG bias amplify real NAV growth. |
| 50–100          | 4–6%                        | Trust becomes mid‑scale; opportunity set narrows; valuations and market efficiency reduce excess returns. |
| 100–150         | 3–4%                        | Portfolio increasingly resembles a global quality index; real returns converge toward long‑run equity norms. |
| 150+            | 2–3%                        | Macro convergence: NAV growth aligns with global real GDP growth plus a modest equity premium. |

# Additional Portfolio Modelling Information

*This section provides the additional assumptions required to run approximate long‑horizon Monte Carlo simulations of portfolio‑level dividend income. These assumptions are intended solely for modelling convenience and internal scenario analysis. They do not alter the investment mandate, portfolio construction rules, or operational instructions defined elsewhere in the SDG documentation.*

## 1. Dividend Growth Modelling

### 1.1 Correlation Matrix
- The **Dividend Correlation** table in the main SDG document is defined as the **dividend‑growth correlation matrix** for all assets.
- These correlations apply exclusively to **annual dividend‑growth shocks**.

### 1.2 Dividend Growth Volatility
- All assets use a **uniform annual dividend‑growth volatility of 5%**, applied to the 5‑year average dividend‑growth rates listed in the main document.
- Annual dividend‑growth shocks follow a **lognormal distribution**.

### 1.3 Zero‑Dividend Assets
- Assets with zero forward yield are assumed to:
  - Never initiate a dividend.
  - Grow NAV normally.
  - Influence income only indirectly through rebalancing flows.

## 2. Dividend Payment Mechanics

### 2.1 Payment Frequency
- All dividends are modelled as **annual payments** occurring at year‑end.

### 2.2 Reinvestment Timing
- During the accumulation phase (until the end of Year 25), dividends are:
  - Paid at year‑end.
  - Reinvested immediately at year‑end using target weights.

## 3. NAV Return Modelling

### 3.1 Return Distribution
- Annual NAV returns follow a **lognormal distribution**.
- Real NAV growth assumptions:
  - Mean: **7%** (midpoint of the 6–8% range).
  - Volatility: **20%**.

### 3.2 NAV Correlation Structure
- All assets share a **uniform pairwise NAV return correlation of 0.7**.
- This correlation applies only to NAV returns.

### 3.3 Independence of NAV and Dividend Growth
- Annual NAV shocks and annual dividend‑growth shocks are assumed to be **independent**.

## 4. Currency Treatment

### 4.1 Base Currency
- All modelling is performed in **GBP real terms**.

### 4.2 FX Assumptions
- FX volatility and FX correlations are **ignored**.
- All dividends and NAV returns are treated as if already expressed in GBP real terms.

## 5. Tax Treatment

### 5.1 Withholding Tax Stability
- Withholding tax rates listed in the **Forward Yield (2026)** table remain **constant for all 30 years**.
- No additional tax drag applies inside the ISA wrapper during the first 25 years.

## 6. Rebalancing Rules

### 6.1 Accumulation Phase (Years 0–25)
- Annual rebalancing to target weights each January.
- All contributions and dividends are invested using target weights.

### 6.2 Post‑Accumulation Phase (Years 26–30)
- Annual rebalancing continues each January.
- 40% of dividends are reinvested using target weights.
- 60% of dividends are withdrawn as income.

## 7. Simulation Structure

### 7.1 Time Step
- Annual time steps for both NAV and dividend modelling.

### 7.2 Number of Trials
- Recommended minimum: **10,000 Monte Carlo paths**.

### 7.3 Output Requirements
- Probability distribution of **annual dividend income** for Years **20–30**, in **GBP real terms**, including:
  - Median income  
  - 5th, 25th, 75th, and 95th percentiles  
  - Worst‑case and best‑case paths  
  - Expected CAGR of income over Years 20–30

## 8. Sequence‑of‑Returns Rules

### 8.1 Annual Order of Operations
1. Apply NAV return.  
2. Apply dividend growth to previous year’s dividend.  
3. Pay dividends at year‑end.  
4. Reinvest dividends (100% until Year 25; 40% thereafter).  
5. Apply contributions (until April 2026 weekly, then monthly until Year 25).  
6. Rebalance annually in January.
