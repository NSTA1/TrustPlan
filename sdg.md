# SDG Design
- A high dividend growth portfolio which is not focused on early-stage yield, but rather on long term compounding of dividends and dividend growth.
- Current 5-year blended dividend growth: 11.7%
- Holdings must be high ROIC equities with global exposure and established dividend track records (with the exception of a few 'dividend initiators': companies that are have ROIC but have recently started paying a dividend or are likely to in future [e.g. Amazon, Meta])

# Perpetual

To be managed by the Trustee of my choice upon my death as covered in my will and under the terms of [Schedule A](Schedule.md)

# Modelling Instructions
- Assume 2.5% average inflation for calculating real returns and/or income
- Assume 8% average annual NAV growth (20% volativity, 0.7% asset correlation)
- Portfolio forward dividend yield at time of initial investment: 1.52%
- Use divident growth table (below) with 5% standard deviation on growth
- Assume zero dividend stocks never initiate unless stated otherwise
- Always use real terms for final output, only show nominal if asked
- Always assume the Investment Plan section is the baseline investment strategy unless stated otherwise
