# Schedule C (Conceptual Outline Only)
## Perpetuity Transition Framework for the Trust + FIC Structure  
*(This Schedule expresses the Founder’s long-term governance intent. A solicitor must convert these principles into legally binding provisions.)*

# Introduction: Trustee Briefing Note  
This briefing note provides the Trustees with a high-level understanding of how the dynasty should transition when the Trust reaches the end of its statutory duration (currently 125 years). The Trust is time-limited under UK law, but the Family Investment Company (FIC) is not. The purpose of this Schedule is to ensure that:

- the FIC continues uninterrupted  
- beneficiaries never receive voting control  
- capital remains locked and compounding  
- the SDG portfolio philosophy remains intact  
- lineage-based income rules continue  
- the Founder’s intent is preserved beyond the lifespan of any individual trust  

The transition must be planned proactively, executed cleanly, and designed to maintain the dynasty’s stability for centuries. This Schedule provides the conceptual framework for that transition.

---

# 1. Purpose of Schedule C  
This Schedule sets out the conceptual framework for ensuring continuity of the dynasty when the Trust reaches the end of its statutory duration. The objective is to:

- Maintain uninterrupted operation of the FIC  
- Preserve the Founder’s intent  
- Prevent beneficiaries from ever receiving voting control  
- Ensure capital remains locked and compounding  
- Maintain lineage-based income distribution  
- Enable the dynasty to continue indefinitely  

---

# 2. Statutory Duration of the Trust  
Under UK law, the Trust will reach its maximum permitted duration after 125 years.  
At that point, the Trust must:

- cease to exist  
- distribute its assets  
- transfer control of the FIC  

This Schedule provides the conceptual plan for that transition.

---

# 3. Successor Trust Framework  
To ensure continuity beyond the 125-year limit, the Trustees should:

1. Establish a **Successor Trust** no later than 24 months before the expiry of the current Trust.  
2. Structure the Successor Trust to preserve:  
   - capital  
   - the SDG investment philosophy  
   - lineage-based income rules  
   - the 60/40 distribution rule  
   - the prohibition on capital access  
   - the prohibition on transfer, sale, or bequest of shares  
3. Transfer all **voting shares of the FIC** to the Successor Trust immediately before the expiry of the current Trust.  
4. Ensure beneficiaries **never** receive voting shares directly.  
5. Maintain continuity of governance, directors, and investment mandate.

---

# 4. Continuity of Governance  
The Trustees should ensure that:

- the FIC continues uninterrupted  
- directors remain in place or are reappointed  
- the SDG portfolio philosophy remains the guiding investment framework  
- the 60/40 rule continues  
- lineage-based income rules remain intact  
- capital remains locked and compounding  

The Successor Trust should mirror the governance principles of the original Trust.

---

# 5. Preservation of Founder’s Intent  
The transition must prioritise:

- capital preservation  
- multi-generational compounding  
- protection of beneficiaries from poverty  
- prevention of capital fragmentation  
- prevention of governance drift  
- fidelity to the SDG portfolio philosophy  
- maintenance of the dynasty’s long-term stability  

The Founder’s intent should override tax optimisation or administrative convenience.

---

# 6. No Beneficiary Control of Voting Shares  
At no point during or after the transition should beneficiaries:

- receive voting shares  
- gain control of the FIC  
- alter the investment mandate  
- access capital  
- modify the 60/40 rule  

Voting control must remain with the Successor Trust or its governance body.

---

# 7. Long-Term Continuity  
This Schedule is intended to ensure that:

- the FIC remains perpetual  
- the dynasty continues beyond the lifespan of any individual trust  
- the SDG portfolio compounds for centuries  
- the governance structure remains stable  
- the Founder’s intent is preserved indefinitely  

---

# 8. Trustee Responsibilities  
Trustees should:

- plan the transition proactively  
- avoid forced or last-minute restructuring  
- ensure legal compliance  
- maintain continuity of operations  
- consult professional advisers  
- document the transition process for future generations  

---

# 9. Interpretation  
This Schedule provides **conceptual guidance only**.  
A solicitor must convert these principles into legally binding provisions within the Successor Trust and related documents.
