# Asset Replacement Check  
**Annual Review — Conducted Every January (Aligned With Dividend‑Weighted Rebalancing)**

This procedure ensures that every holding continues to meet the Strategy Document’s standards for dividend‑growth quality, ROIC strength, and long‑term compounding suitability.  
It is mechanical, trustee‑ready, and designed to prevent both false positives and unnecessary churn.

---

## 1. Replacement Rules (Summary)

An asset must be **evaluated** if any of the following occur:

### **1.1 Dividend‑Growth Triggers**
- 5‑year dividend growth **< 5%**, OR  
- 3‑year dividend growth **< 3%**, OR  
- **Any dividend cut** (immediate Watchlist entry)

### **1.2 ROIC Triggers**
- ROIC **< 15%**, OR  
- ROIC has fallen **≥ 25%** from its 5‑year average

### **1.3 Payout Ratio Triggers**
- Payout ratio **> 60%**, OR  
- Payout ratio has increased **≥ 20 percentage points** in 3 years

### **1.4 Strategic Thesis Triggers**
- Loss of pricing power  
- Moat deterioration  
- Material regulatory impairment  
- Business model shift away from global, scalable, intangible‑asset‑driven compounding

---

## 2. Confirmation Window

### **2.1 Dividend Cut**
- Immediate Watchlist entry  
- **6‑month confirmation window**

### **2.2 All Other Triggers**
- Immediate Watchlist entry  
- **12‑month confirmation window**

If the issue resolves within the window → asset is removed from the Watchlist.  
If the issue persists → asset is replaced.

# 4. Annual January Procedure (Step‑By‑Step)

Perform the following steps **for each asset**:

### **Step 1 — Update Metrics**
Record:
- 5‑year DG  
- 3‑year DG  
- Last 12 months DG  
- ROIC (current + 5‑year average)  
- Payout ratio  
- Notes on moat, pricing power, regulatory environment

### **Step 2 — Apply Trigger Rules**
If **any** trigger condition is met:
- Move the asset to the **Watchlist**  
- Mark the appropriate **confirmation window** (6 or 12 months)

### **Step 3 — Review Existing Watchlist Items**
For each Watchlist asset:
- Check whether the confirmation window has expired  
- If expired:
  - If the issue persists → **Replace the asset**  
  - If the issue has resolved → **Remove from Watchlist**

### **Step 4 — Replacement (If Required)**
If replacement is triggered:
- Select the highest‑ranked compliant asset  
- Add the new asset at the target allocation  
- Remove the old asset entirely  
- Document the rationale

### **Step 5 — Update Watchlist Log**
Record:
- New entries  
- Resolved entries  
- Replacements executed  
- Notes for next year’s review
