The Trustees must manage the Portfolio in accordance with the following principles:

1. **Capital Preservation:**  
   The capital of the Portfolio shall not be distributed to beneficiaries.

2. **Dividend Income Distribution:**  
   All dividends received shall be distributed to the income beneficiaries in accordance with the SDG20 Income Distribution Clause.

3. **Long‑Term Compounding:**  
   The Portfolio shall prioritise companies with high return on invested capital (ROIC), durable competitive advantages, and long‑term earnings growth.

4. **Low Turnover:**  
   The Portfolio shall be managed with minimal trading activity.  
   Discretionary selling is prohibited except as permitted in Section 6 or the Dividend‑Growth Integrity Clause.

---

## 4. Dividend Growth Requirements  
### (Guidance, with mandatory protections in the Dividend‑Growth Integrity Clause)

The Trustees shall prioritise companies that demonstrate:

- A **history of consistent dividend growth**, and  
- A **long‑term dividend growth rate typically exceeding inflation**, and  
- A **sustainable payout ratio** consistent with reinvestment and future growth.

**Note:**  
These criteria are guiding principles.  
Mandatory protections and sell triggers are defined exclusively in the **SDG20 Dividend‑Growth Integrity Clause**.

---

## 5. Rebalancing Rules

The Trustees shall:

- Rebalance only to maintain sleeve allocations within ±3%  
- Avoid discretionary rebalancing  
- Avoid selling solely for short‑term performance reasons  
- Maintain the 20‑asset structure unless replacement is required under Section 6 or the Dividend‑Growth Integrity Clause

---

## 6. Asset Replacement Rules

An asset may be replaced only if:

1. The company ceases to exist (e.g., acquisition, delisting),  
2. The company becomes legally or practically impossible to hold,  
3. The company undergoes structural deterioration that permanently violates the principles in Section 3, or  
4. Replacement is required under the SDG20 Dividend‑Growth Integrity Clause.

Replacement assets must:

- Fit the same sleeve classification as the asset being replaced,  
- Meet the same quality criteria set out in this Schedule,  
- **Fully comply with all requirements of the SDG20 Dividend‑Growth Integrity Clause**, including minimum dividend‑growth, ROIC, and competitive‑advantage standards,  
- Maintain or improve the Portfolio’s long‑term compounding characteristics,  
- Not reduce the Portfolio’s Blended Dividend‑Growth Rate below the minimum threshold defined in the SDG20 Dividend‑Growth Integrity Clause.

---

## 7. Prohibited Actions

The Trustees shall not:

- Liquidate the Portfolio except as required by law  
- Distribute capital to beneficiaries  
- Replace assets for short‑term performance reasons  
- Deviate from the SDG20 structure without cause under Section 6 or the Dividend‑Growth Integrity Clause  
- Follow beneficiary instructions regarding investment decisions

---

## 8. Purpose of the Schedule

This Schedule is intended to preserve the integrity of the SDG20 investment strategy across generations, ensuring that beneficiaries receive sustainable income while the capital base continues to grow over time.

# SDG20 Dividend‑Growth Integrity Clause  
### (Trustee Replacement Protocol)

### 1. Purpose
To preserve the structural integrity and long‑term compounding capacity of the Portfolio by maintaining a blended dividend‑growth rate (“Blended DG”) of not less than 9.5% per annum.

### 2. Definitions

2.2 “Blended DG” means the weighted average DG of all holdings.

2.3 “Structural Failure” means the occurrence of two (2) or more criteria in Section 3.

2.4 “Temporary Variance” means any short‑term fluctuation not meeting Structural Failure.

### 3. Structural Failure Criteria

3.1 **DG Underperformance**  
(a) Five‑year DG below six percent (6%); and  
(b) At least three (3) percentage points below Blended DG.

3.2 **Earnings Power Deterioration**  
(a) Five‑year EPS CAGR below five percent (5%); or  
(b) ROIC decline of twenty percent (20%) or more.

3.3 **Dividend Policy Impairment**  
(a) Dividend freeze for two (2) consecutive years; or  
(b) Any dividend reduction, unless arising from a one‑off restructuring.

3.4 **Strategic or Competitive Impairment**  
(a) Loss of competitive moat;  
(b) Credit rating downgrade to BBB or below;  
(c) Negative free cash flow for three (3) consecutive years.

3.5 **Portfolio‑Level Impact**  
Blended DG falls below 9.5% for two (2) consecutive years.

### 4. Monitoring and Review Procedure

4.1 **Watchlist Placement**  
A holding meeting Structural Failure criteria shall be placed on a Watchlist for twelve (12) months.

4.2 **Monitoring Requirements**  
Quarterly review of DG, EPS, ROIC, dividend policy, and competitive position.

4.3 **Replacement Trigger**  
A holding must be replaced if, after the Watchlist period:  
(a) It still meets two (2) or more Structural Failure criteria; or  
(b) Blended DG remains below 9.5% for two (2) consecutive years.

### 5. Replacement Requirements

5.1 Replacement holdings must:  
(a) Exhibit five‑year DG ≥ 10%;  
(b) Exhibit ROIC ≥ 15%;  
(c) Be large‑cap or mega‑cap;  
(d) Fit the relevant sleeve.

5.2 Replacement must not reduce Blended DG below 9.5%.

### 6. Safeguards

6.1 **Market Stress Provision**  
Trustees may defer disposal for up to twelve (12) months if the holding is down more than thirty percent (30%) from its three‑year high.

6.2 **No Beneficiary Influence**  
Beneficiaries shall have no right to influence decisions under this Clause.

6.3 **Preservation of Long‑Term Philosophy**  
Trustees shall avoid unnecessary turnover arising from short‑term volatility.

# SDG20 Income Distribution Clause

### 6. Succession on Death

6.1 **Death of an Adult Beneficiary**

(c) A Beneficiary’s share does not form part of their estate.  
(d) Trustees shall not recognise any attempted assignment or testamentary direction.

### 7. Protection of Minors

7.1 Trustees must ensure income paid to a Guardian is used solely for the Minor.

7.2 Trustees may require evidence of expenditure or pay expenses directly.

### 8. Lineage‑Based Transition

8.1 **Immediate Lineage Succession**  
Upon death, a Beneficiary’s share passes immediately to their blood descendants.

8.2 **Reinvestment Where No Bloodline Exists**  
If no descendants exist, the share is permanently reinvested.

8.3 **Concurrent Multi‑Generational Distributions**  
Multiple generations may receive income concurrently, provided each entitlement arises solely from direct lineage.

8.4 **No Generation‑Level Requirement**  
A younger generation may receive income even while older generations remain alive.

8.5 **Equal Per‑Capita Division**  
Where a deceased Beneficiary leaves multiple descendants, their inherited share is divided equally.
