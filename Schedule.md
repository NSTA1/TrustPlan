# Schedule A  
## Investment Mandate and Portfolio Philosophy  
*(To be read together with Schedule B. Schedule A defines the investment philosophy and portfolio rules; Schedule B defines the structural implementation via the Trust + FIC architecture.)*

---

# 1. Purpose of Schedule A

This Schedule sets out the Founder’s investment philosophy, portfolio construction rules, and long‑term compounding intent.  

The operational structure through which this mandate is implemented is defined in **[ScheduleB.md](ScheduleB.md)**.  
If ambiguity arises, Schedule A governs *investment philosophy and asset selection*, while Schedule B governs *structure, governance, and implementation*.

---

# 2. Core Investment Philosophy

The SDG Portfolio (as defined in **sdg.md**) is designed to:

- Provide rising, inflation‑beating dividend income  
- Compound capital over multiple generations  
- Maintain global diversification  
- Operate with low turnover  
- Prioritise dividend growth over dividend yield  
- Preserve capital in perpetuity  

The Founder intends that the SDG Portfolio shall be implemented through the structure defined in **[ScheduleB.md](ScheduleB.md)**.

---

# 3. Portfolio Construction Rules

## 3.1 Asset Universe
The SDG Portfolio shall consist exclusively of assets permitted under **sdg.md**, including:

- High‑quality global equities  
- Strong ROIC, durable competitive advantages  
- Consistent dividend growth  
- Low leverage  
- Predictable cash flows  

No derivatives, leverage, or speculative instruments are permitted.

## 3.2 Number of Holdings
The portfolio shall contain:

- **20–30 core holdings**, as defined in **sdg.md**  
- Each selected according to the screening criteria in **sdg.md**

## 3.3 Replacement Criteria
Assets may be replaced only when the criteria in **sdg.md** are triggered, including:

- Dividend growth deterioration  
- ROIC collapse  
- Earnings deterioration  
- Strategic impairment  
- Competitive advantage erosion  
- Dividend policy weakening  

Replacement events shall be executed through the structure defined in **[ScheduleB.md](ScheduleB.md)**.

---

# 4. Turnover and Rebalancing

## 4.1 Low‑Turnover Mandate
The SDG Portfolio is intended to be a **low‑turnover, buy‑and‑hold** portfolio.  
Turnover shall be minimised to preserve compounding and reduce tax drag.

## 4.2 Rebalancing
Rebalancing shall occur only when:

- A position exceeds risk thresholds  
- A replacement event is triggered under **sdg.md**  
- A corporate action requires it  

Rebalancing shall be executed within the FIC structure described in **[ScheduleB.md](ScheduleB.md)**.

---

# 5. Income Philosophy

## 5.1 Dividend Growth Priority
Dividend growth is the primary driver of long‑term compounding.  
The portfolio shall favour companies that:

- Grow dividends faster than inflation  
- Maintain sustainable payout ratios  
- Demonstrate consistent earnings growth  

## 5.2 Distribution Mechanism
The Founder’s intent is that:

- Beneficiaries receive **income only**, not capital  
- Capital remains invested indefinitely  
- The 60/40 Rule (defined in **[ScheduleB.md](ScheduleB.md)**) governs distributions  

Schedule A defines *what* the portfolio must achieve; Schedule B defines *how* distributions occur.

---

# 6. Capital Preservation

Capital must remain invested in the SDG Portfolio and may not be distributed.  
This principle is implemented structurally through the Trust + FIC architecture defined in **[ScheduleB.md](ScheduleB.md)**.

---

# 7. Governance and Interpretation

## 7.1 Relationship Between Schedules
- **Schedule A** defines the investment philosophy, portfolio rules, and replacement criteria.  
- **Schedule B** defines the structural implementation, including the Trust + FIC pairing, the 60/40 Rule, and governance mechanisms.  
- **sdg.md** defines the canonical SDG Portfolio, screening rules, and replacement triggers.

## 7.2 Interpretation
If ambiguity arises:

1. **Schedule A** governs investment philosophy and asset selection.  
2. **sdg.md** governs the specific portfolio and screening rules.  
3. **Schedule B** governs structure, governance, and implementation.  

All documents must be interpreted to preserve:

- Capital  
- Compounding  
- Dividend growth  
- Multi‑generational benefit  
- The Founder’s intent  

---

# 8. Final Intent

The Founder intends that:

- The SDG Portfolio shall compound for centuries  
- Capital shall remain protected and invested  
- Income shall rise across generations  
- Beneficiaries shall never control or liquidate capital  
- The Trust + FIC structure in **[ScheduleB.md](ScheduleB.md)** shall be used to implement this mandate  
- All decisions shall favour long‑term compounding, stability, and fidelity to the SDG philosophy
