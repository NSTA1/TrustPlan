## Monthly Income Observations

1. **Seasonal Concentration**: December (20.2%) and June (16.2%) are the largest income months due to European and Japanese semi-annual payouts aligning with US quarterly payments.

2. **Lean Months**: February and August are the lowest income months (3.0% each), with only Mastercard and Accenture paying.

3. **Income Smoothing**: The quarterly US holdings (40% of portfolio) provide baseline income every month, while European/Japanese holdings create peaks.

4. **May Concentration**: May (11.8%) is the third-largest income month due to annual European payouts (EssilorLuxottica, L'Oréal, Hermès, Schneider Electric) plus semi-annual ASML and LSEG.

5. **Median Year 30 Monthly Range**:
   - Base Case: £1,407 (August) to £9,468 (December)
   - Optimistic Case: £963 (August) to £6,480 (December)
   - Pessimistic Case: £3,034 (August) to £20,428 (December)

6. **New Holdings Impact**:
   - Badger Meter (BMI) pays quarterly in March, June, September, December - adding to infrastructure income
   - Schneider Electric (SU) pays annually in May - adding to the European annual payout concentration
