## Monthly Income Observations

1. **Seasonal Concentration**: December (18.8%) and June (15.8%) are the largest income months due to European and Japanese semi-annual payouts aligning with US quarterly payments.

2. **Lean Months**: February and August are the lowest income months (3.3% each), with only Mastercard, Accenture, and General Dynamics paying.

3. **Income Smoothing**: The quarterly US holdings (42% of portfolio) provide baseline income every month, while European/Japanese holdings create peaks.

4. **Median Year 30 Monthly Range**:
   - Base Case: £1,528 (August) to £8,706 (December)
   - Optimistic Case: £1,046 (August) to £5,960 (December)
   - Pessimistic Case: £3,295 (August) to £18,768 (December)
